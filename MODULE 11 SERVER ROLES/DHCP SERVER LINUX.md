OBJECTIVES
--
UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR DHCP SERVER ROLE
EXPLAIN HOW DHCP OPERATES
INSTALL DHCP ON CENTOS AND UBUNTU.

USING DHCP TO MANAGE IP ADDRESS ASSIGNMENT
--
EVERY DEVICE ON A NETWORK REQUIRES AN IP ADDRESS.
THE DYNAMIC HOST CONTROL PROTOCOL (DHCP) IS USED TO HAND OUT(ASSIGN) IP ADDRESSES TO DEVICE AUTOMATICALLY.
DHCP ALSO DISTRIBUTES REQUIRED NETWORK INFORMATION LIKE:
GATEWAY IP ADDRESS.
NAME SERVER
NETWORK MASK.
A DHCP SERVER KEEPS TRACK OF ALL IP ADDRESSES:
- ENSURES DEVICES HAVE UNIQUE IP ADDRESSES
- ESTABLISH A LEASE TIME FOR ALL IP ADDRESSES.
- AFTER LEASE EXPIRES THE IP ADDRESS IS RETURNED TO A POOL, AVAILABLE FOR USE BY DHCP.

DHCP IN DETAIL
--
CLIENTS SEND DHCP DISCOVERY MESSAGE ON PORT 67.
DHCP SENDS IP OFFER ON PORT 68.
THE CLIENT RESPONDS WITH A REQUEST ACCEPTING THE IP (ON PORT 67); THE DHCP SERVER ACKNOWLEDGES THE RESPONSE (ON PORT 68).
THE WHOLE PROCESS IS CALLED DORA. D FOR DISCOVERY, O FOR OFFER, R FOR REQUEST AND A FOR ACKNOWLEGDEMENT.

LET'S SEE HOW DHCP SERVER IS INSTALLED

INSTALLING DHCP SERVER ON CENTOS
--
DNF INSTALL DHCP-SERVER
CONFIG FILE:
/ETC/DHCP/DHCPD.CONF
AFTER MAKING CONFIGURATION:
RESTART SERVICE WITH:
SYSTEMCTL --ENABLE-NOW DHCPD
ADD TO FIREWALL IF ITS RUNNING:
FIREWALL-CMD --ADD-SERVICE=DHCP --PERMANENT && FIREWALL-CMD RELOAD- TO RELOAD

INSTALLING IN UBUNTU
--
APT-GET INSTALL isc-dhcp-server 
CONFIG FILE:
/ETC/DHCP/DHCPD.CONF
TO ENABLE THE SERVICE:
SYSTEMCTL --ENABLE-NOW isc-dhcp-server.
CHECK STATUS

DHCP USES PORT 67(TO REQUEST FOR IP BY THE CLIENT) AND 68(TO SEND OUT IP ADDRESS).
