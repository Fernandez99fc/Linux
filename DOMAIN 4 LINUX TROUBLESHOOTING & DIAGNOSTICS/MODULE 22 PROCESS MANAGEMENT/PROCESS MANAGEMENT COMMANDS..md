OBJECTIVES
UNDERSTAND HOW TO EXAMINE PROCESSES.
EXPLAIN HOW TO DETERMINE WHAT FILES ARE BEING USED BY A PROCESS.
USE THE COMMAND PS, LSOF, PGREP.

EXAMINING PROCESSES WITH PS(PROCESS STATUS)
--
IN LINUX, THE PROCESS STATUS(PS) COMMAND IS USED TO VIEW PROCESSES; RUNNING WITH NO OPTIONS LISTS:
- PROCESS IDS(PIDS).
- TERMINAL WHERE THE PROCESS US RUNNING.
- THE LENGTH OF THE CPU TIME THE PROCESS HAS BEEN RUNNING.
- THE PROCESS COMMAND ITSELF.

THE PS COMMAND HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME, AND HAS GATHERED A TON OF OPTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE;
- DISPLAY ALL PROCESSES ON THE SYSTEM: PS -EF
- DISPLAY ALL PROCESSES ON THE SYSTEM USING THE BSD SYNTAX: PS AUX
- PS AUX DISPLAYS MORE INFO SUCH AS PROCESS STATE.

FINDING FILES IN USE WITH THE LSOF COMMAND
--
THE LSOF COMMAND LISTS OPEN FILES; WHEN USED WITH NO OPTION, IT LISTS ALL OPEN FILES ON THE OS. LSOF IS OFTEN USEFUL WHEN YOURE TRYING TO FIND FILES THAT ARE IN USE;
- IN A DIRECTORY; LSOF <DIRECTORY>
-BY A USER;LSOF -u <USER>
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF OUR DISCUSSION TODAY, THE MOST IMPORTANT LSOF OPTION IS TO DISPLAY FILES USED BY A PROCESS ;
  LSOF -P <PID>

PROCESS SEARCH WITH PGREP
--
THE PS COMMAND DISPLAYS A LOT OF OUTPUT, SO GENERALLY ITS PIPED TO GREP TO SEARCH FOR A STRING, FOR EXAMPLE: PS AUX | GREP NETWORKMANAGER.
LINUX ALSO PROVIDES THE PGREP COMMAND THAT TAKES IN THE GREP SEARCH STRING AND QUERIES PS:
PGREP -l <STRING>- RETURNS PID AND PROCESS NAME.
PGREP -a <STRING>- RETURNS PID AND FULL COMMAND STRING.

WHERE PGREP REALLY SHINES IS WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND A PROCESS BY USER NAME:
PGREP -au ROB.
