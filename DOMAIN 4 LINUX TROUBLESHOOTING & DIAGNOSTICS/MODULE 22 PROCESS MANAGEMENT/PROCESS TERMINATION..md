OBJECTIVES
--
UNDERSTAND WHY PROCESSES MAY NEED TO BE TERMINATED.
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF KILL SIGNALS.
USE THE KILL, KILLALL AND PKILL COMMANDS.

THE NEED TO TERMINATE A PROCESS
--
OCCASSIONALLY, PROCESSES WILL GET HUNG UP:
- SOMETIMES THE PROCESS RESUMES ON ITS OWN
- THE PROCESS MIGHT NEED A LITTLE HELP.

A PROCESS TERMINATION IS REQUIRED WHEN A PROCESS IS NOT ONLY HUNG UP BUT IS TYING UP RESOURCES AND ITS CAUSING OTHER PROCESSES ISSUES.
IN ALL CASE, A COMMAND IS REQUIRED TO CONTROL THE PROCESS, IN WHAT IS KNOWN AS INTER-PROCESS COMMUNICATION.
- LINUX USES SIGNALS TO PERFORM INTER-PROCESS COMMUNICATION..

LINUX PROCESS(KILL)SIGNAL
--
A PROCESS SIGNAL IS A PREDEFINED MESSAGE THAT MOST WELL WRITTEN APPLICATIONS CAN RECEIVE AND ACT ON.
- THIS LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE DEVELOPER AND HOW THE APPLICATION WAS WRITTEN.

THERE ARE 31 SIGNALS, BUT WE ONLY NEED  A FEW FOR THE LINUX+ EXAM:

 SIGHUP(1)-"SIGNAL HANG UP"- RELOADS PROCESS WITH THE SAME PID
 
 SIGINT(2)-SIGNAL INTERRUPT- THIS IS WHAT CTRL+C DOES
 
SIGKILL(9)-FORCIBLY KILLS A PROCESS.

SIGTERM(15)-TERMINATES A PROCESS GRACEFULLY

SIGTSTP(20)-STOP THE TERMINAL/PAUSE A PROCESS - WHAT CTRL+Z DOES.
THE KILL COMMAND

THE KILL COMMAND IS WHAT WE USE TO TERMINATE OR SIGNAL A PROCESS. BY DEFAULT, IT TAKES THE PID OF A PROCESS AND TERMINATES IT GRACEFULLY WITH SIGTERM(15): KILL <PID>

KILL HAS ALOT OF SYNTAX OPTIONS; THESE ARE ALL EXAMPLE OPTIONS TO TERMINATE GRACEFULLY:
KILL 15 <PID>

KILL -TERM <PID>

KILL -s TERM <PID>


KILL -s 15 <PID>
KILL -s SIGTERM <PID>

SIGTERM(15) IS ALWAYS THE BEST OPTION TO START: YOU CAN SPECIFY SIGKILL(9) AS LAST RESORT:
KILL -9 <PID>

THE LINUX KILLALL AND PKILL COMMANDS
--
THERE ARE TWO OTHER KILL-RELATED COMMANDS YOU SHOULD KNOW FOR THE EXAM.

KILLALL COMMAND IS USED TO KILL ALL PROCESSES THAT SHARES A NAME OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS:
- KILLALL HTTPD- KILLS ALL PROCESSES NAMED HTTPD(WEB)
- 
- KILLALL -u <USER>- KILLS ALL PROCESSED OWNED BY THE USER.

PKILL CAN ALSO KILL ALL PROCESSES THAT SHARE A NAME:

PKILL APACHE2- KILLS ALL APACHE2(WEB) PROCESSES.
