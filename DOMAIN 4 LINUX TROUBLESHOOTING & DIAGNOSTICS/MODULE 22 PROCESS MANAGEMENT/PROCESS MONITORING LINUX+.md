UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PROCESSES AND PROCESS MONITORING.
UNDERSTAND HOW  A PROCESS ID IS GENERATED.
USE THE TOP, HTOP AND TIME COMMANDS.

PROCESS MANAGING IS MANAGING LINUX
--
THE PERFORMANCE OF A SYSTEM NOT ONLY DEPENDS ON THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE BUT ALSO ON THE PROCESSES RUNNING ON THAT SYSTEM AT ANY GIVE TIME.
- TO MANAGE LINUX, YOU HAVE TO UNDESTAND HOW PROCESSES WORKS WITH THE LINUX OS.

SINCE PROCESSES ARE UBIQUITOUS, WE NEED TO ENSURE WE MONITOR PROCESSES AND KNOW HOW TO DO SO.
- BUT FIRST, LETS COVER SOME OF THE BASICS.

IN LINUX, EACH PROGRAM IS A PROCESS: A PROCESS CAN RUN IN THE FOREGROUND AND DISPLAY OUTPUT TO A CONSOLE OR RUN IN THE BACKGROUND, PERFORMING WORK ON DATA BEHIND SCENES.

PROCESS ID(PID)
--
LINUX ASSIGNS EACH PROCESS A PROCESS ID AND THIS IS USED TO IDENTIFY AND MANAGE A PROCESS.
WHEN LINUX FIRST BOOTS UP, IT CALLS THE INIT PROCESS OR SYSTEMD IN NEWER SYSTEMS.
- THE INIT OR SYSTEMD PROCESS STARTS ALL OTHER PROCESSES ON THE SYSTEM.
- INIT OR SYSTEMD ALWAYS HAS THE PROCESS ID(PID) TO BE 1

ALL OTHER PROCESSES ARE ASSIGNED PROCESS ID RANDOMLY FROM THE TABLE OF AVAILABLE PID NUMBERS KEPT BY THE OS. ADDITIONALLY, NON-INIT PROCESSES HAVE;
- PARENT PROCESS ID(PPID)-PID NUMBER OF THE PROCESS'S PARENT.
- ALL PROCESSES ARE CHILDREN OF INIT, BUT MAY HAVE SPAWNED FROM ANOTHER PROCESS AS WELL WHICH MIGHT BE THE IMMEDIATE PARENT AND SYSTEMD OR INIT BEING THE GRANDPARENT.

PROCESS MONITORING COMMANDS
--
TO MONITOR PROCESSES IN REAL TIME, WE CAN USE THE "TOP" COMMAND TO DISPLAY PROCESS INFORMATION.
THE "HTOP" COMMAND ALSO DISPLAYS PROCESS INFORMATION IN REAL TIME, BUT PROVIDES BETTER VISUAL IDENTIFICATION OF SYSTEM LOAD AND COLOR OUTPUT.
WE CAN USE THE "TIME" COMMAND TO  DETERMINE HOW LONG IT TAKES A COMMAND TO RUN.

TOP
--
BY DEFAULT, TOP SORTS BY THE HIGHEST CPU USAGE. YOU CAN CHANGE IT TO SORT BY THE HIGHEST MEMORY USAGE BY PRESSING "SHIFT M". TO SORT BY CPU, PRESS "SHIFT P"

HTOP
--
SAME APPROACH APPLIES TO IT.

TIME
--
REAL- OVERALL TIME THE COMMAND TOOK TO RUN
USER-THE CPU TIME TAKEN BY THE USER PROCESS
SYS -THE CPU TIME TAKEN BY THE SYSTEM PROCESS
