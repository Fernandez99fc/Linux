OBJECTIVES
--
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PROCESS PRIORITY.
EXPLAIN THE RANGE OF LINUX PROCESS PRIORITY
USE THE NICE AND RENICE COMMANDS TO CHANGE PROCESS PRIORITY.

LINUX IS A MULTITASKING OS AND IT CYCLES CPU TIME BETWEEN PROCESSES WHICH MAKES THEM APPEAR TO RUN CONCURRENTLY.
- WE'VE SPOKEN OF SWAP AND CONTEXT SWITCHING 
- THESE ARE ALSO PART OF MULTITASKING DONE BY THE OS.

TO KEEP UP THE APPEARANCE OF PROCESS CONCURRENCE, LINUX TRIES TO GIVE EQUAL CPU TIME TO EACH PROCESS.

BUT WHAT IF YOU WANT TO GIVE A CERTAIN PROCESS MORE IMPORTANCE?

THE PRIORITY LEVEL OF A PROCESS SPECIFIES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROCESS, RELATIVE TO OTHER PROCESSES.

THE BETTER THE PRIORITY, THE MORE CPU TIME THE PROCESS RECEIVES.

PROCESS PRIORITY RANGE
--
THE PRIORITY OF A PROCESS IS THEREFORE DETERMINED ON A SCALE OF +19 TO -20 SCALE. THE LOWER THE VALUE THE HIGHER THE PRIORITY OF THE PROCESS.
THE DEFAULT VALUE IS PROCESS PRIORITY 0. 0 IS THE PRIORITY OF MOST PROCESSES.

THE NICE COMMAND
--
THE PROCESS PRIORITY CAN BE SET USING THE NICE COMMAND. NICE IS ONLY USED WHEN STARTING A PROCESS WITH SYNTAX;
NICE -n <LEVEL> <COMMAND>

NOTE: IF A LEVEL IS NOT SPECIFIED, IT IS SET TO PRIORITY 10: NICE BY DEFAULT PRIORTIY LEVEL IS 10, NOT 0.

USERS CAN START A PROCESS WITH A LOWER PRIORITY (NUMBER 1 TO 19).
ONLY PRIVILEDGED USERS OR ROOT CAN START A PROCESS WITH A HIGHER PRIORITY(LOWER NUMBER -1 TO -20)

THE NICENESS OF A PROCESS CAN BE SEEN IN THE NI COLUMN IN TOP.

RENICE COMMAND
--
PROCESS PRIORITY CAN BE CHANGED USING THE RENICE COMMAND.
AM ORDINARY USER CAN INCREASE THE NICE VALUE(LOWER THE PRIORITY ) WITH RENICE:
RENICE <NICE_VALUE_FROM_1_TO_+19> <PID>

A PRIVILEDGED USER OR ROOT CAN DECREASE THE NICE VALUE(INCREASE THE PRIORITY ) WITH RENICE:
SUDO RENICE <NICE_VALUE_FROM_-1TO_-20> <PID>

THE NICE VALUE CAN ALSO BE SEEN WITH PS BUT YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY COLUMNS WITH PS -EO:
PS -EO USER, PID, NICE, %CPU, %MEM, STAT, START, TIME, COMMAND
