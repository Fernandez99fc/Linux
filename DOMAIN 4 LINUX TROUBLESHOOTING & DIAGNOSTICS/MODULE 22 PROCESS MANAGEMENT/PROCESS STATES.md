OBJECTIVES
--
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PROCESS STATES.

PROCESS STATES:RUNNING
--
A PROGRAM THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING HANDLED IS A RUNNING PROCESS. THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN LOADED FROM THE STORAGE INTO SYSTEM RAM AND ITS BEEN PROCESSES BY THE CPU.
RUNNING PROCESSES ARE DESIGNATED WITH THE "R" SYMBOL IN THE STATUS COLUMN.

PROCESS STATES:SLEEP
--
A PROCESS NOT BEING HANDLED IS OFTEN SWAPPED INTO VIRTUAL MEMORY.(SWAP SPACE ON DISK).
PROCESSES SWAPPED INTO VIRTUAL MEMORY ARE CALLED SLEEPING PROCESSES.
PROCESSES OFTEN SLEEP WHILE WAITING FOR AN EVENT OR INPUT/OUTPUT.

THERE'S NO POINT FOR A SLEEPING PROCESS TO TAKE UP A CPU AND MEMORY TIME THAT CAN BE USED BY A RUNNING PROCESS, THATS THE REASON IT GETS SWAPPED INTO THE VIRTUAL MEMORY.

ONCE AN EVENT TRIGGERS, TWO THINGS MAY HAPPEN:
- PROCESSES IN INTERRUPTIBLE SLEEP IMMEDIATELY WAKE UP WHEN THE KERNEL SIGNALS THE PROCESS. MAYBE THEY WILL TRASNFER THEIR INFORMATION FROM THE VIRTUAL MEMORY TO THE PHYSICAL MEMORY.
- PROCESSES IN UNITNTERRUPTIBLE SLEEP ONLY WAKE UP WHEN AN EXTERNAL EVENT TRIGGERS, GENERALLY WAITING ON I/O FROM THE NETWORK OR DISK HARDWARE. LIKEWISE, THESE PROCESSES ARE WAITING FOR AN I/O FROM A NETWORK OR A DISK HARDWARE I/O.

INTERRUPTIBLE SLEEP IS DESIGNATED BY "S" AND UNINTERRUPTIBLE SLEEP IS DESIGNATED BY "D" IN THE STATUS COLUMN.

PROCESS  STATES: ZOMBIE
--
WHEN A PROCESS HAS ENDED AND IT'S PARENT PROCESS HASN'T ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROCESS TERMINATION, IT BECOMES A ZOMBIE; THIS CAN HAPPEN FOR A FEW REASON:
- CHILD PROCESS TERMINATES WHEN PARENT PROCESS IS SLEEPING.
- CHILD PROCESS TERMINATES WHEN PARENT PROCESS IS RUNNING ABNORMALLY.
- PARENT PROCESS DIES BEFORE CHILD PROCESS; TERMINATION SIGNAL IS NEVER RECEIVED.

ZOMBIE PROCESSES ARE STUCK UNTIL:
- PARENTS ACKNOWLEDGES THE TERMINATION SIGNAL.
- ZOMBIE PROCESS CLEANED UP MANUALLY OR UPON SYSTEM REBOOT.

ZOMBIE PROCESSES ARE DESIGNATED BY 'Z' IN THE STATUS COLUMN..
