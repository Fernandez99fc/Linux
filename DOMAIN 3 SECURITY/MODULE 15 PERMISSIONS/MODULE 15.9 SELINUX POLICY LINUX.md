OBJECTIVES----------------
Understand the concept of SELinux policies
Understand the sestatus command to view extended SELinux Properties.
Locate the SELinux root and targeted directories

SELINUX IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST MISUSE AND UNAUTHORIZED USE SUCH AS: UNAUTHORIZED READING OF DATA AND PROGRAMS . UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATION OF DATA AND PROGRAMS. BYPASSING APPLICATION SECURITY MECHANISM.

SELINUX POLICIES
-- 
SELINUX HAS THREE POLICY TYPES(SOMETIMES LABELED SELINUXTYPE)

TARGETED(DEFAULT)------
ALLOWS ADMINISTRATORS TO DEFINE FINE-GRAINED CONTEXTS
ALLOWS TYPE SECURITY - WHICH RESTRICTS ACCESS BASED ON SPECIFIC TYPES OF CONTEXTS

WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT, ADMINISTRATORS CAN SELECT PROCESSES TO BE TARGETED FOR PROTECTION.


THIS IS THE ONLY POLICY ON THE LINUX+ EXAM

MINIMUM-----------
SUPPORTS A MINIMAL(OR SELECTED )SET OF PROCESS OBJECTS
NOT ON THE EXAM, INCLUDED HERE AS REFERENCE.

MLS(MULTI LAYER SECURITY)
USED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ;USES BELL LAPADULA MODEL
DEFINES LEVELS APPLIED TO OBJECTS WITH C0 BEING MINIMAL AND C3 BEING TOP SECRET
NOT ON THE EXAM, BUT WILL BE ON COMPTIA SECURITY+

EXTENDED SELIINUX INFORMATION WITH SESTATUS
--
TO VIEW THE SELINUX POLICY CONFIGURED ON YOUR SYSTEM , RUN THE "SESTATUS" COMMAND .
SESTATUS ALSO DISPLAYS THE MODE AND LOCATION OF SOME IMPORTANT FILES (LIKE SELINUX ROOT)

[rob@centos8 ~]$ sestatus
SELinux status:                                  enabled
SELinux mount:                                 /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:                     /etc/selinux
Loaded Policy name:                        targeted
current mode:                                   enforcing
mode from config file:                      enforcing
Policy MLS status:                              enabled 
Policy deny_unknown status:              allowed
Memory Protection checking:            actual (secure)
Max Kernel Policy version:                   32

WE CAN ALSO SEE OUR SELINUX ROOT DIRECTORY WHICH IS THE /ETC/SELINUX. WE CAN READ THE "CONFIG " FILE IN THERE.
THE "CONFIG " FILE IS WHERE THE "LOADED POLICY NAME" AND THE "MODE" SETTINGS CAN BE SET TO BE PERSISTENT.

CHECKING THE "TARGETED" DIRECTORY.
WE CAN SEE THE "POLICY" AND "CONTEXTS" DIRECTORIES. THIS IS WHERE SELINUX STORES AND RECORDS THESE THINGS FOR IT'S USE
