STICKY BIT
--
STICKY BIT, IF SET ON A DIRECTORY, IT MEANS NO ONE CAN DELETE THE CONTENT OF THE DIRECTORY OR THE DIRECTORY ITSELF EXCEPT THE PERSON WHO CREATED IT.
IF USER "SINZZU" MAKES A DIRECTORY AND INSIDE THE DIRECORY ARE SOME IMPORTANT FILES AND HE DOESN'T WANT ANY OTHER USER ASIDES ROOT TO DELETE THEM, EVEN IF THEY HAVE THE "RWX" PERMISSION. HE CAN SIMPLY APPLY A STICKY BIT PERMISSION ON THE DIRECTORY OR THE FILE ITSELF SO THAT NOBODY WILL BE ABLE TO DELETE THEM. HAS EFFECT ON BOTH FILES AND DIRECTORIES.

SETGID
--
SETGID, WHEN SET MEANS THE GROUP OWNERSHIP WILL BE INHERITED TO ALL THE CONTENT OF THE DIRECTORY WHEN CREATED.
WHEN A USER CREATES A DIRECTORY, ANY USER WHO CREATES  A FILE IN THE DIRECTORY , THE FILE WILL BE GIVEN GROUP OWNERSHIP AS THE CREATOR'S GROUP/NAME.
ANY PERMISSION GIVEN TO THE DIRECTORY BY THE CREATOR WILL BE INHERITED BY THE RESOURCES IN IT..
SGID HAS NO EFFECT ON FILES ONLY ON DIRECTORIES

SETUID
--
SETUID BIT MEANS THE COMMAND WILL BE RUN WITH OWNER RIGHTS INSTEAD OF THE RIGHT OF THE EXECUTER. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO OR WHICH USER RUNS THE COMMAND, THE COMMAND WILL BE RAN AS IT IS BEEN RAN BY THE OWNER OF THAT PARTICULAR FILE.

EXPLANATION
--
FOR EXAMPLE, ROOT OWNS A DIRECTORY OR A FILE, ROOT SETS PERMISSIONS ON THE DIRECTORY DRWX --- ----. READ, WRITE AND EXECUTE FOR THE USER OWNER AND NO PERMISSION FOR THE GROUP AND OTHER.  THE USER "SINZZU" HAS NO PERMISSION TO SEE THE CONTENT OF THE DIRECTORY AND NEITHER ACCESS IT. SINZZU TRIES THE "LS " COMMAND TO SEE THE CONTENT OF THE DIRECTORY, HE GOT AN "PERMISSION DENIED ERROR" BECAUSE HE HAS NO PERMISSION TO THE DIRECTORY. WITHOUT ROOT, CHANGING THE PERMISSION OF THE DIRECTORY FOR GROUP AND OTHER USERS TO HAVE PERMISSION TO THE DIRECTORY, ROOT CAN APPLY  A SETUID PERMISSION BIT ON COMMANDS THE USERS NEED TO ACCESS THE DIRECTORY AND ITS CONTENT.

WHEN SINZZU TRIED THE "LS " COMMAND TO LIST THE CONTENTS OF THE DIRECTORY, HE GOT DENIED BECAUSE HE HAD NO PERMISSION, ROOT CAN THEREBY APPLY  A SETUID PERMISSION BITS ON THE "LS" COMMAND TO MAKE SINZZU OR ANY OTHER USER TO HAVE RIGHT TO USE THE "LS" COMMAND ON ANY FILE OR DIRECTORY EVEN IF THEY HAVE NO PERMISSION OVER IT.

IF SINZZU WANTS TO REMOVE SOMETHING FROM THE DIRECTORY, ROOT(THE OWNER OF THE "LS" COMMAND) WILL PLACE A SETUID BIT ON THE "LS" COMMAND.


FILES NOT IN A DIRECTORY
--
WHEN A FILE HAS NO DIRECTORY PATH, IT IS OPEN FOR ANY PERMISSION TO TAKE PLACE BY ANY USER, GROUP AND OTHER...
IT IS BEST TO PLACE FILES IN DIRECTORIES FOR PROPER SECURITY...
