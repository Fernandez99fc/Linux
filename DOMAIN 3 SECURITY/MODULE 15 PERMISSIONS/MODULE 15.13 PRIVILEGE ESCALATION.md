UNDERTSAND HOW TO PERFORM PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
EXPLAIN THEPURPOSE OF PRIVILEDGE ESCALATION GROUPS AND HOW TO ADD USER TO PRIVILEDGE GROUPS

PRIVILEDGE ESCALTION OVERVIEW
--
ALTHOUGH THE ROOT USER HAS COMPLETE SYSTEM ACCESS. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE IT FOR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION WORK:
- SHARING ROOT PASSWORD CAN BE DANGEROUS IF IT FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS.
- DIFFICULT TO AUDIT WORK DONE AS ROOT ACCOUNT WHEN THE ACCOUNT IS SHARED.

INSTEAD, THE GENERAL BEST PRACTICE TO USE A STANDARD USER ACCOUNT AND USE PRIVILEDGE ESCALATION TO RUN PROGRAMS WITH ROOT PRIVILEGES.
THERE ARE THREE COMMANDS THAT MAY BE USED TO PERFORM PRIVILEDGE ESCALATION: SU.SUDO AND SUDOEDIT.

PRIVILEDGE ESCALATION COMMANDS
--
SU(SUBSTITUTE USER):
- ALLOWS A STANDARD USER TO RUN COMMANDS AS ANOTHER USER
- CAN BECOME THE ROOT USER: SU -
- MUST STILL KNOW THE ROOT PASSWORD TO BECOME ROOT.

SUDO(SUBSTITUTE USER DO)
- SAFER OPTION THAN SU, DOESN'T REQUIRE USER TO KNOW ROOT PASSWORD.
- STANDARD USER RUNS COMMANDS AS ROOT BY PROVIDING THEIR PASSWORD.
- USER ACCOUNT MUST BE IN PRIVILEGE GROUP.

SUDOEDIT:
- COMMAND ALLOWS A STANDARD USER TO EDIT FILE AS ROOT
- WORKS THE SAME AS SUDO -USER PROVIDES THEIR OWN PASSWORD TO EDIT FILE.

PRIVILEDGE GROUPS
--
USERS HAVE TO BE ADDED TO A PRIVILEDGE GROUP TO RECEIVE SUDO PRIVILDGES.
- USERS CAN BE ADDED TO THIS GROUP WITH USERMOD.

WHEEL- PRIVILEDGE GROUP FOR RED HAT BASED DISTROS(FEDORA, CENTOS)
SUDO- PRIVILEDGE GORUP FOR DEBIAN BASED DISTROS(UBUNTU, LINUX MINT)
ADDITIONALLY, THIS GROUPS MAY NEED TO BE ENABLED IN THE SUDOERS FILE: /ETC/SUDO

IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY , INSTEAD USE THE VISUDO COMMAND.
