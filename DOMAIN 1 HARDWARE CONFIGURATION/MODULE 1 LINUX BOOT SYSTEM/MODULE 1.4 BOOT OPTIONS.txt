OBJECTIVES-------- 
1)Booting with ISO 
2)Understandign the different Options for accessing an ISO 
3)Understand how systems boot from NFS 

An ISO Image is a file holding the content of an optical disc,DVD/CD. Having the data in a file format rather tthan a physical cd/dvd which can distribute the data easily. We can also access the ISO file remotely to install an operating system on a computer. 

ISO REMOTE ACCESS METHODS 
Remote access to the ISO Image can be made through the http or ftp. Using FTP allows data to be transferred bit-by-bit and can be secure using SFTP(SECURE FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL)using the SSH 22 Port. HTTP Allows connection over port 80. 

(NFS). 
It is a remote booting method that uses NETWORK FILE SYSTEM. A computer boots with a kernel image or gets one from the TFTFP server (like PXE). Next the system will connect to the NFS server on the network and access the root file system
