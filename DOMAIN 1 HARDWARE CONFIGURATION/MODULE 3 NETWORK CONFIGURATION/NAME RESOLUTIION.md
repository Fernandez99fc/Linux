/ETC/HOSTS FILE
--
CONTAINS HOST NAMES OF REMOTE SERVER/SYSTEMS USED FOR COMMUNICATING WITHOUT SPECIFYING THE ADDRESS. ONCE A HOSTNAME IS ADDED TO THIS FILE, IT BECOMES RECOGNIZED BY THE SYSTEM. INSTEAD OF THE DEVICE TO TALK TO A DNS SERVER, IT TALKS TO THE HOSTNAME DIRECTLY...
IT IS A FILE USED BY THE OPERATING SYSTEM TO RESOLVE HOSTNAMES TO IP ADDRESS. A LINE ADDED TO THE FILE WILL HELP REOLVE  THE HOSTNAME TO THE IP ADDRESS.
MAINLY USED IN A HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING(HPC) ENVIRONMENT, WHEREBY ALL SERVER'S IP ADDRESSES WILL BE ADDED IN A FILE AND THE FILE WILL GET DISTRIBUTED TO EACH SERVER FOR EASY COMMUNICATION...
