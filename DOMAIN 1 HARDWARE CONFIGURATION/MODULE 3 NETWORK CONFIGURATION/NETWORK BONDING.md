OBJECTIVES
--
UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF NETWORK BONDING IN LINUX.
DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENT BOND MODES.
KNOW HOW TO CONFIGURE A NETWORK BOND

NETWORK BONDING
--
NETWORK BONDING ALLOWS A LINUX SYSTEM TO SEE MULTIPLE NETWORK INTERFACES AS A SINGLE NETWORK INTERFACE
THE BOND MODES ARE:
AGGREGATION (MODE #4)- ALL INTERFACES IN THE BOND ARE COMBINED TO CREATE A LARGER NETWORK "PIPE".
ACTIVE/PASSIVE (MODE #1)- ONE INTERFACE IS UP/ACTIVE AND THE OTHER IS AVAILABLE OR PASSIVE IN CASE THE ACTIVE INTERFACE FAILS
LOAD BALANCING(MODE #5)- NETWORK TRAFFIC IS SHARED BETWEEN ALL INTERFACES IN THE BOND.

CONFIGURING A BOND
--
IN CENTOS YOU CAN CONFIGURE A BOND BY CREATING A BOND SCRIPT FILE AT:
/ETC/SYSCONFIG/NETWORK-SCRIPTS/IFCONFIG-<BOND NAME>
YOU WOULD CONFIGURE THE BOND IN THE FILE, SPECIFYING THE BOND MODE AND OTHER SETTINGS.
FINALLY, YOU WOULD MODIFY INDIVIDUAL INTERFACES AND ADD THEM TO THE BOND.

IN UBUNTU, YOU CAN CONFIGURE A BOND BY CREATING A BOND FILE AT:
/ETC/NETWORK/INTERFACES.

ALTERNATIVELY, YOU CAN CREATE A BOND MANAGER THROUGH THE NMCLI OR NMTUI\
