OBJECTIVES
-
- EXPLAIN NETWORK ROUTING IN LINUX
- KNOW HOW TO USE THE ROUTE COMMAND
- USE THE IP COMMAND FOR ROUTING
- SET A PERSISTENT ROUTER.

ROUTING
--
- ROUTING IS SIMPLY SENDING DATA FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER THROUGH A GATEWAY.
- ROUTING CAN BE STRAIGHT-FORWARD
- THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO WORK WITH ROUTING IN LINUX.

ROUTE
--
- ROUTE -r AND NETSTAT -r DISPLAY A ROUTING TABLE.
- ROUTE -n DISPLAYS DESTINATION NUMERICALLY.
- NETSTAT -r DISPLAYS COLUMN INFO
- IP ROUTER SHOW IS A COLLAPSED OUTPUT.

THE DESTINATION COLUMN SHOWS THE DESTINATION NETWORK OR HOST
THE GATEWAY COLUMN SHOWS THE GATEWAY USED BY THE NETWORK OR HOST.

THE ROUTE COMMAND IN LINUX IS FOR ROUTING
USING THE ROUTE COMMAND WITH NO OPTIONS SIMPLY DISPLAYS THE ROUTING TABLE.

YOU CAN ADD OR DELETE A ROUTE:
- ROUTE ADD <TARGET> GW <IP ADDRESS> 
- ROUTE DELETE <TARGET> GW <IP ADDRESS>
CHANGES ARE NOT PERSISTENT.

NETWORK ROUTING WITH IP COMMAND
--
THE IP COMMAND CAN ALSO BE USED FOR ROUTING: IP ROUTE BY ITSELF PRINTS  A COLLAPSED ROUTING TABLE.

YOU CAN ADD OR DELETE A ROUTE:
- IP ROUTE ADD <TARGET> VIA <GATEWAY> DEV <DEVICE>
- IP ROUTE DEL <TARGET>
CHANGES ARE NOT PERSISTENT.

AS MENTIONED, THE ROUTING CHANGES USING ROUTE AND IP COMMANDS ARE NOT PERSISTENT.
THESE ARE TWO OPTIONS FOR PERSISTENCE FOR ROUTING IN CENTOS.

1) ENTER  A GATEWAY LINE IN THE INTERFACE FILE:
- /ETC/SYSCONFIG/NETWORK-SCRIPTS/IFCFG-<INTERFACE>
OR CREATE A ROUTE FILE FOR THE INTERFACE:
- /ETC/SYSCONFIG/NETWORK-SCRIPTS/ROUTE-<INTERFACE>

THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS FOR PERSISTENCE FOR ROUTING IN UBUNTU:

ENTER A ROUTE SECTION IN THE NETPLAN YAML CONFIG:
- /ETC/NETPLAN/<CONFIG>.YAML
  
MODIFY THE INTERFACE USING NMCLI OR NMTUI
FLAG

THE FLAG COLUMN CAN INDICATE A FEW THINGS DEPENDING IN THE FLAG;
- U- HOST IS UP
- G- USE GATEWAY
- H- TARGET IS  A HOST

THE METRIC COLUMN SHOWS DISTANCE TO THE TARGET(IN HOPS).
THE IFACE COLUMN SPECIFIES THE INTERFACE THAT WILL HANDLE TRAFFIC FOR ROUTE..
