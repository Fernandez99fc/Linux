OBJECTIVES

- UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THE SYSCTL.CONF FILE
- EXPLAIN WHY YOU WOULD MODIFY THIS FILE FOR NETWORK CONFIGURATION..

THE SYSCTL.CONF FILE IS USED TO SET PERSISTENT KERNEL PARAMETERS TO TUNE A LINUX SYSTEM.

THE SYSCTL COMMAND IS USED TO CONFIGURE KERNEL PARAMETERS (NON-PERSISTENT).

YOU GENERALLY USE THE SYSCTL COMMAND TO MAKE CHANGES, TEST THE CHANGES AND IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT, YOU CAN MAKE A PERSISTENT CHANGE IN THE SYSCTL.CONF FILE..

THE KERNEL SETTINGS IN SYSCTL.CONF ARE ENABLED ON BOOT.

THE SYSCTL.CONF FILE IS MENTIONED IN THE MODULE BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SOME TUNING SETTINGS RELATED TO NETWORKING.
