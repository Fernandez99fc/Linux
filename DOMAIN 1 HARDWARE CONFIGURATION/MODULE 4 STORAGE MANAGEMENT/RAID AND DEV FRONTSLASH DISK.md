/DEV/SDB AND /DEV/SDC FOR THE DEVICES.

LESS /PROC/MDSTAT- TO SEE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEWLY CREATED RAID ARRAYS AND IT SHOWS HOW THE TWO DISKS ARE BING SYNCED FOR CONSISTENT MIRRORING BECAUSE WE CHOSE RAID 1 WHICH IS MIRRORING. THE TWO DISKS WILL BE MIRRORED.\

WE CAN SEE MORE DEVICES WITH THE --DETAILS COMMAND:
MDADM --DETAIL /DEV/MD1
WE CAN ALSO SEE INFORMATION USING THE LSBLK COMMAND AND BLKID.

ANOTHER PLACE WHERE WE CAN SEE INFORMATION IS IN THE /DEV/DISK DIRECTORY WHICH WILL BE ASKED IN LINUX. IN THIS DIRECTORY, WE CAN SEE OUR DEVICE/DISK INFORMATION BY UUID,BY PATH,BY PARTUUID, BY ID
