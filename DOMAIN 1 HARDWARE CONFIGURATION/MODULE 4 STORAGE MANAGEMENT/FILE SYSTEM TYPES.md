OBJECTIVES
-
UNDERSTAND REAL AND VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEMS IN LINUX.
EXPLAIN THE LINUX FILE SYSTEM HIERARCHY
LEVERAGE THE /DEV AND /SYS DIRECTORIES.

REAL FILE SYSTEMS AND VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEMS.
--
REAL FILE SYSTEMS ARE FILE SYSTEMS THAT ARE ON THE DISK. THESE FILE SYSTEMS EXIST ON A PHYSICAL STORAGE DEVICE. WE CAN USE THE LSBLK COMMAND TO VIEW IT OR LS ON /PROC/PARTITIONS. EXAMPLES ARE /HOME /PART/ [SWAP]. THEY ALL LIVE ON THE DISK AND ITS PARTITIONS.
VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM
--

LINUX USES VIRTUAL DIRECORY STRUCTURES. KERNEL MODULES AND AN ABSTRACTION LAYER CALLED THE VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM (VFS) MAKE UP THE DEFAULT IMPLEMENTATION..
THE VIEW OF THE LINUX FILE SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY A VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM(VFS).

FILE SYSTEM HIERARCHY STANDARDS(FHS)
--
LINUX AND UNIX BOTH HAVE THE CONCEPT CALLED THE FILE SYSTEM HIERARCHY STANDARD (FHS).
THE STANDARD FORMAT FOR THE LINUX VIRTUAL DIRECTORY IS THE FHS.
THE FHS DEFINES THE SUGGESTED LOCATION FOR DIRECTORIES AND FILES..

SOME COMMON FILE SYSTEM HIERARCHY DIRECTORIES
--
/ROOT- THE ROOT DIRECTORY, THE REAL FILE SYSTEM.
/BOOT- CONTAINS OUR BOOT FILES..
/HOME-CONTAINS USER FILES, MOUNT OR REAL FILE SYSTEM
/OPT-DATA FOR OPTIONAL THIRD PARTY TOOL
/USR-DATA FOR STANDARD LINUX PROGRAMS.
/DEV-A PSEUDO FILESYSTEM THAT CONTAINS DEVICE FILES.]-PSEUDO FILESYSTEMS
/SYS-A PSEUDO FILESYSTEM THAT PROVIDE DEVICE AND BUS INFO.]PSEUDO // //
/PROC-A PSEUDO FILESYSTEM PROVIDING PROCESS INFORMATION..]PSEUDO //

/DEV
--
AS MENTIONED BEFORE, /DEV IS A PSEUDO OR VIRTUAL FILESYSTEM .
THIS FILE SYSTEM LIVES IN THE MEMORY AND NOT STORED ON DISK.

THE /DEV DIRECTORY IS USED BY THE KERNEL TO ACCESS PHYSICAL DEVICES.

/SYS
--
THE /SYS DIRECTORY IS A PSEUDO OR VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM AND IT IS STORED IN MEMORY AND NOT ON DISC.
THE /SYS DIRECTORY IS USED BY THE KERNEL TO GET INFORMATION ON DEVICES AND BUSES.
