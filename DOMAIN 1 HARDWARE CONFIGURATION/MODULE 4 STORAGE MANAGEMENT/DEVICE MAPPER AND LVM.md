OBJECTIVES
---
UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THE DEVICE MAPPER.
UNDERSTAND HOW LOGICAL DEVICES ARE CONSTRUCTED WITH LVM.
SEE HOW LVM AND DEVICE MAPPER WORK TOGETHER.

DEVICE MAPPER
---
SO FAR WE HAVE SEEN REGULAR DEVICES; AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNED PREDICTABLE DEVICE NAMES:
THE FIRST DISK IS /DEV/SDA
THE SECOND DISK IS DEV/SDC.

HOWEVER, LINUX HAS ANOTHER TYPE OF DEVICE CALLED A LOGICAL VOLUME. THESE DEVICES DONT HAVE PREDICTABLE, AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNED DEVICES NAMES.
LOGICAL VOLUME USE THE "DEVICE MAPPER".

LOGICAL VOLUME MANAGER(LVM)
---
LOGICAL VOLUME MANAGER ALLOWS FOR ONE OR MORE PHYSICAL DEVICES TO BE AGGREGATED INTO A SINGLE CONTAINER, THESE CAN BE:
ENTIRE DISK
RAID DEVICES
DISK PARTITIONS.
YOU'RE BRINGING TOGETHER DIFFERENT DEVICES TO MAKE UP A SINGLE LARGE STORAGE.

LOGICAL VOLUME CREATION OVERVIEW
--
1) AGGREGATE DEVICES INTO A PHYSICAL VOLUME(PV) WITH THE PV CREATE COMMAND:
PVCREATE /DEV/<DEVICE1> /DEV/<DEVICE2>
2)PVS ARE ADDED INTO A VOLUME GROUP(VG) WITH THE VGCREATE COMMAND:
VGCREATE <VG_NAME> /DEV/<DEVICE1> /DEV/<DEVICE2>
3) FINALLY, CREATE THE LOGICAL VOLUME WITH THE LVCREATE COMMAND:
LVCREATE -n <LV_NAME> -L <SIZE> <VG_NAME>

CREATING A LOGICAL VOLUME
-----------------------------------------------------------
CREATE A PHYSICAL VOLUME:
PVCREATE /DEV/SDB /DEV/SDC

CREATE A VOLUME GROUP:
VGCREATE VG1 /DEV/SDB /DEV/SDC

CREATE A LOGICAL VOLUME :
LVCREATE -n LV1 -L 1GB VG1

LOGICAL VOLUME: CREATION COMPLETED
---
RESULT: /DEV/VG1/LV1
LOGICAL VOLUME WITH THE 1 GB OF SPACE ON TWO PHYSICAL DEVICES. THIS IS A LOGICAL VOLUME WITH 1GB OF SPACE ON TWO PHYSICAL DEVICES.

WHAT ABOUT DEVICE MAPPERS
--
DEVICE MAPPER TAKES OVER AT THIS POINT. WHY?
BECAUSE /DEV/VG1/LV1 ISN'T REALLY A DEVICE. /DEV/VG1/LV1 IS A SYMBOLIC LINK TO:
