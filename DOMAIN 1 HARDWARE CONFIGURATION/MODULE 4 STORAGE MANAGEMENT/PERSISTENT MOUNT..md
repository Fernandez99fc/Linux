- UNDERSTAND HOW PERSISTENT MOUNT WORKS.
- CREATE A PERSISTENT MOUNT ENTRY IN THE /ETC/FSTAB FILE.
- EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF /ETC/CRYPTTAB.

THE /ETC/FSTAB IS USED TO CONFIGURE PERSISTENT MOUNT

ADD THE UUID OF THE BLOCKS HAVING FILESYSTEMS TO /ETC/FSTAB": FOR ME I USED ;
blkid | tail -n 2 | awk -F " " '{print$2}' >> /etc/fstab.

then after, you remove the quotations

IN THE /ETC/FSTAB, IN EACH COLUMN WE SHOULD SPECIFY THE FILE SYSTEM MOUNT POINT, NAME OF FILE SYSTEM E.T.C

RUN mount -a - AUTO MOUNT ANY FILE SYSTEM IN FINDS IN /ETC/FSTAB.

/ETC/CRYPTTAB FILE
--
THIS FILE IS USE TO PERSIST A MOUNT ON AN ENCRYPTED DRIVE. LINUX USES SOMETHING CALLED LINUX UNIFIED KEY SETUP FOR DRIVE ENCRYPTION. THESE DRIVES ARE DECRYPTED DURING THE BOOT PROCESS. 
SO THE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PUT INTO THE /ETC/CRYPTTAB FILE SO THAT LINUX KNOWS HOW TO DECRYPT THE DRIVE ON BOOT UP
