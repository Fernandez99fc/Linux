OBJ-:
USE THE DEVICE MAPPER COMMANDS LIKE: PVCREATE, VGCREATE AND LVCREATE.

INTERPRET /DEV/MAPPER CONTENT

PVCREATE /DEV/SDB /DEV/SDC

STATUS: PHYSICAL VOLUME "/DEV/SDB" SUCCESSFULLY CREATED

STATUS: PHYSICAL VOLUME "/DEV/SDC" SUCCESSFULLY CREATED.

WE CAN DISPLAY THIS WITH THE "PVDISPLAY " COMMAND. THIS IS WE SHOW US WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE TWO DEVICES.
COMMAND: PVDISPLAY.

TO CREATE A LOGICAL VOLUME, THE NEXT STEP IS TO CREATE OUR VOLUME GROUP.
--
VGCREATE VG1 /DEV/SDB /DEV/SDC.

STATUS: VOLUME GROUP "VG1" HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY CREATED.

TO DISPLAY THIS, WE WILL RUN THE VGDISPLAY COMMAND.
COMMAND:VGDISPLAY

FINAL STEP, IS TO CREATE A LOGICAL VOLUME
--
LVCREATE -n LV1 -L 1GB VG1

STATUS: LOGICAL VOLUME LV1 CREATED.

WE CAN ALSO DISPLAY WITH "LVDISPLAY.".

THEN WE CAN LS -AL /DEV/VG1/LV1. WE SEE A POINTER POINITING TO ..DM-0.

WE CAN SIMPLY USE AN ABSOLUTE PATH TO NAVIGATE TO IT BY USING LS -AL /DEV/MAPPER

WHAT IF WE WANT DO REMOVE OUR LOGICAL VOLUMES, PHYSICAL VOLUME AND VOLUME GROUP
--
JUST LIKE WE HAVE THE "CREATE" AND "DISPLAY" COMMANDS,WE ALSO HAVE THE DELETE COMMAND.

LVREMOVE /VG1/LV1- TO REMOVE OUR LOGICAL VOLUME.

TO REMOVE VOLUME GROUP- VGREMOVE VG1.

LAST THING TO DO IS TO REMOVE THE PHYSICAL VOLUME:
PVREMOVE /DEV/SDB /DEV/SDC

AND WHEN LS /DEV/MAPPER- WE SEE NOTHING. NO ..D(M-0(DEVICE MAPPER-0) ANYMORE..

DEV MAPPER FILES ARE CREATED WHEN YOU SETUP A LOGICAL VOLUME. 



THANKS!
