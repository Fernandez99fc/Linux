OBJECTIVES
-
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN XFS AND EXT
USE THE MKFS COMMAND TO CREATE FILE SYSTEMS.

THE EXT3 FILESYSTEM
--
THE LINUX EXTENDED FILE SYSTEM(EXT) HAD BEEN THE DEFAULT FILESYSTEM IN LINUX FOR A VERY LONG TIME. BEGINNING WITH EXT2.
EXT3 WAS AN IMPROVEMENT OF EXT2, IN THAT IT SUPPORTS JOURNALING. JOURNALING IS A CONCEPT THAT PREVENTS FILESYSTEM CORRUPTION BY TRACKING ALL CHNAGES MADE TO FILES IN A JOURNAL LOG. IF THE SYSTEM CRASHES, THE FILESYSTEM CAN BE RECOVERED BECAUSE THE JOURNAL CAN PLAYBACK ANY CHANGES AND RECOVER FILE METADATA.

THE EXT4 FILE SYSTEM.
--
EXT4 WAS AN IMPROVEMENT FROM EXT3.
IT SUPPORTS LARGER FILESYSTEMS UP TO 1EB(EXABYTE).
IT SUPPORTS LARGER FILE SIZE UP TO 16TB
IMPROVES PERFORMANCE OF FILESYSTEMS CHECK AND DEFRAGMENTATION.
UBUNTU STILL USES EXT4 FS BY DEFAULT

THE XFS FILESYSTEM
--
XFS BECAME DEFAULT FILESYSTEM FOR RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX 7 (RHEL 7) AND HAS BEEN THE DEFAULT SINCE 2014.
XFS TENDS TO BE FASTER ON LARGER DRIVES THAN EXT4. 
YOU CAN SHRINK AN EXT4 BUT YOU CANT SHRINK XFS FILE SYSTEM.

MKFS COMMAND TO CREATE FILE SYSTEM
--
MKFS -t EXT4 /DEV/SDB1- TO MAKE A FILE SYSTEM ON THE PARTITION.
MKFS.XFS -f /DEV/SDC1
