DESCRIBE EXTERNAL FILESYSTEMS USED IN LINUX.
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NFS,SMB AND NTFS.
EXPLAIN MULTIPATHING IN LINUX.

NFS(NETWORK FILE SYSTEM)--
IS A STANDARD USED FOR ACCESSING STORAGE ON A NETWORK. AN NFS SHARE IS MOUNTED (EXPORTED) TO MAKE THE SHARE AVAILABLE.
THE "SHOWMOUNT " COMMAND CAN BE USED TO DISPLAY NFS MOUNTS:
SHOWMOUNT -e <NFS_SYSTEM_NAME>]

TO ACCESS A NFS DIRECTORY, IT MUST BE MOUNTED USING THE MOUNT COMMAND:
MOUNT -t NFS <NFS_SYSTEM_NAME>:<EXPORT> <MOUNT POINT>.
FOR EXAMPLE, AN NFS SERVER NAMED NFSERVER WITH AN EXPORT CALLED /FILES AND A MOUNT POINT OF /MNT/FILE:
MOUNT -t NFS NFSERVER:/FILES /MNT/FILES.

SMB(SERVER MESSAGE BLOCK)
----
WINDOWS FILE SYSTEM USES SERVER MESSAGE BLOCK FOR NETWORK STORAGE. 
COMMON INTERNET FILE SYSTEM(CIFS) AND SMB ARE OFTEN USED INTERCHANGEABLY. LINUX HAS A CLIENT FOR SMB CALLED SAMBA.

ACCESSING AND MOUNTING SMB SHARES
--
YOU CAN USE THE SMBCLIENT COMMAND TO VIEW AND ACCESS SMB SHARED FILE SYSTEMS:
SMBCLIENT -L <SERVER_NAME> -U <USER_NAME>
SMB SHARES CAN ALSO BE MOUNTED WITH THE MOUNT COMMAND.
EXAMPLE, AN SMB SERVER NAMED WIN1 WITH AN EXPORT CALLED /FILE AND A MOUNT POINT OF /MNT/FILE:
MOUNT //WIN1/FILES /MNT/FILES.

NTFS
----
NTFS IS EITHER THE NT FILE SYSTEM OR NEW TECHNOLOGY FILE SYSTEM(DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ASK). IT IS THE DEFAULT FILE SYSTEM FOR MICROSOFT WINDOWS.
NTFS CAN  BE USED IN LINUX, BU I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. SEE NTFS -3G FOR MORE INFO.
I BELIEVE THIS IS ONLY MENTIONED IN THE EXAM BLUEPRINT TO DRILL THIS INTO YOUR HEAD - NTFS CAN BE USED.

MULTIPATHING
----
YOU MAY LOSE ACCESS TO A REMOTE STORAGE IF THE PATH IS LOST. MULTIPATHING ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE MULTIPLE PATHS TO A REMOTE STORAGE DEVICE.
YOU CAN BOTH AGGREGATE THE PATHS FOR INCREASED THROUGHPUT AND USE THEM FOR FAULT TOLERANCE IF A PATH IS LOST.
THE KPARX COMMAND IS USED TO CREATE A MULTIPATH STORAGE DEVICE ENTRIES.

MULTIPATHING AND DEVICE MAPPER.
-------
THE COMMAND MULTIPATH IS USED TO VIEW AND DETECT MULTIPATH DEVICES.
MULTIPATHING IN LINUX IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH DEVICE MAPPER MULTIPATHING. 
THE DM-MULTIPATH KERNEL MODULE PROVIDED MULTIPATH SUPPORT.
- LINUX CREATES AN MPATH FILE IN /DEV/MAPPER  FOR EACH NEW MULTIPATH STORAGE DEVICE ADDED. THIS WORKS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DEVICE FILE.
