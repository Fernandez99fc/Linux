OBJECTIVES
--
UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF AN ABSOLUTE PATH.
DIFFERENTIATE AN ABSOLUTE PATH FROM A RELATIVE PATH.
DETERMINE WHEN TO USE ONE OVER THE OTHER

ABSOLUTE PATH VS RELATIVE PATH
---
AN ABSOLUTE PATH IS A DIRECT PATH TO A FILE OR COMMAND. IT IS ABSOLUTE BECAUSE IT IS THE TRUE LOCATION OF THE COMMAND.
ABSOLUTE PATHS ALWAYS STARTS FROM THE ROOT(/).
EXAMPLE: "LESS /ETC/HOSTS". IT IS DIRECT BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO VISIT THE MAIN DIRECTORY HAVING THE "HOSTS" FILE BEFORE WE COULD READ IT AND IT STARTS WITH A ROOT[/] FIRST.

RELATIVE PATH
--
A RELATIVE PATH IS A PATH TO A FILE OR COMMAND RELATIVE TO THE DIRECTORY YOU'RE IN.
AN EXAMPLE IS "CD /ETC. THEN "LESS HOSTS". IT IS RELATIVE BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO BE IN THE /ETC DIRECTORY BEFORE WE COULD READ THE FILE.
WE CAN ADD THE FILE'S DIRECTORY TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS "PATH" COVERED IN BASH SCRIPTING, SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO RUN THE COMMAND FROM ANYWHERE AND BASH WILL USE THE PATH TO FIND THE FILE'S DIRECTORY BEFORE IT GETS EXECUTED.
