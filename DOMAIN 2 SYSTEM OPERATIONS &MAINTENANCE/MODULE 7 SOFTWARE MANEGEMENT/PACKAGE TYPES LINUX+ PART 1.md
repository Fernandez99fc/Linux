OBJECTIVES 
--
EXPLAIN DIFFERENT PACKAGE TYPES
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN RPM, DEB, TAR, TGZ, AND GZ PACKAGES...

PACKAGE MANAGERS AND PACKAGES
--
A PACKAGE MANAGER IS A SOFTWARE APPLICATION THAT IS USED TO SEARCH,DOWNLOAD,INSTALL,REMOVE AND UPDATE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS IN AN OPERATING SYSTEM. THEY CAN BE IN FORM OF A GUI OR COMMAND LINE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IS FOR EASY INSTALLATION OF SOFWARE PACKAGES RATHER THAN GOING TO WEBSITES TO LOOK FOR PACKAGES, ALSO FOR SECURITY. LINUX HAS SOURCES TO GET THIS PACKAGES FROM. THIS PACKAGES SOURCE ARE CALLED REPOSITORIES. REPOSITORIES STORES A LIST OF AVAILABLE PACKAGES. WHEN A PACKAGE VERSION IS BEING UPDATED IN THE PACKAGE REPOSITORY, THE PACKAGE MANAGER DOWNLOADS THE PACKAGE FROM ITS REPOSITORY WHEN THE USER IS READY TO DOWNLOAD. PACKAGES HAVE DEPENDENCIES, SO PACKAGE MANAGERS LIKE APT GO OUT THERE TO DOWNLOAD THE DEPENDENCIES BEFORE INSTALLING THE PACKAGE. WHEN YOU INSTALL A SOFTWARE WITH APT, YOU BASICALLY DOWNLOAD A DEB PACKAGE FROM REPOSITORY.

PACKAGE VS SOFTWARE
--
A PACKAGE CONSISTS OF COMPILED FILES REQUIRED TO BUILD A SOFTWARE. A PACKAGE CONSISTS OF SCRIPTS AND CONFIGURATIONS REQUIRED FOR  A SOFTWARE TO RUN. IN LINUX, SOFTWARES ARE INSTALLED IN PACKAGES. A SOFTWARE IS A TOOL THAT MAKES THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE USER AND THE HARDWARE...

RPM
--
THE RED HAT PACKAGE MANAGER (RPM) WAS DEVELOPED BY RED HAT, BUT RPM PACKAGES ARE USED BY RED HAT BASED DISTROS LIKE CENTOS, FEDORA AND SCIENTIFIC LINUX..

THE RPM PACKAGE CAN BE INSTALLED WITH THE RPM COMMAND WHICH WE'LL COVER IN THE NEXT LESSON..
DEB
--
THE DEB PACKAGE IS USED BY DISTRIBUTIONS BASED ON DEBIAN, SUCH AS UBUNTU. THE DPKG COMMAND IS USED TO INSTALL DEB PACKAGES ON DEBIAN BASED SYSTEMS.

WE WILL WORK WITH THE DPKG COMMAND IN A FEW LESSONS....

THE TAPE ARCHIVER(TAR), GZIP AND TGZIP
--
IN LINUX, ARCHIVING AND COMPRESSION ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS;
TAR-TO PUT MULTIPLE FILES INTO A SINGLE TAR FILE.
GZIP- COMPRESSES A FILE

SO TO GET A COMPRESSED ARCHIVE, YOU WILL FIRSTLY USE TAR TO ARCHIVE THEN GZIP TO COMPRESS AND THE OUTPUT WILL BE :file.tar.gz AS SAID BELOW...

TAR---
THE TAPE ARCHIVER PROGRAM IS USED TO BUNDLE FILES TOGETHER INTO A TAR FILE.
- TAR IS NOT USED FOR INSTALLING SOFTWARES

GZIP---
THE GZIP PROGRAM ALLOWS YOU TO COMPRESS ZIP FILES

TAR FILES CAN BE COMPRESSED WITH GZIP SEPERATELY AND THE OUTPUT WILL LOOK LIKE: file.tar.gz
HOWEVER, THE TAR COMMAND CAN COMPRESS THE FILES WITH GZIP AS IT ARCHIVES; THE RESULT TAR FILE IS A TGZ FILE: file.tgz

tar.gz and .tgz are the same

WHY WOULD SOMEONE PICK A TAR  AND TGZ FILE OVER A PACKAGE FILE WITH A BUILT IN INSTALLER(MEANING, WHY WOULD SOMEONE PICK A FILE HAVING TAR OR TAR.GZ OVER A FILE WITH THE .RPM OR .DEB PACKAGE FORMAT FOR INSTALLATION).

SOFTWARE MAINTENERS OFTEN DISTRIBUTE THEIR SOFTWARE AS SOURCE CODE. 
- THIS CODE IS UNCOMPLIED
- IT IS NOT PACKAGED UP INTO RPM OR DPKG FORMAT..
IT IS MORE EFFICIENT TO BUNDLE THIS SOFTWARE UP!
