OBJECTIVES 
--
WORK WITH RPM FILES BY USING THE RPM COMMAND.
[[RPM COMMANDS]]
RED HAT PACKAGE MANAGER(RPM) PACKAGES
--
THE RED HAT PACKAGE MANAGER WAS THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE MANAGER FOR WORKING WITH RPM PACKAGES. MOST PACKAGE INSTALLS ARE NOW DONE WITH YUM,DNF OR ZYPPER.
- WE'LL COVER THESE IN THE UPCOMING LESSONS...

THE RPM COMMAND IS USED TO INSTALL RPM PACKAGES WITH THE RPM PACKAGE MANAGER..

DEMO TIME
--
FILE NAME = HTTPD-2.4.37-21.MODULE_EL8.2.0+494+1DF74EAE.X86_64 .RPM
WE WANT TO INSTALL RPM PACKAGES OF THIS HTTPD SERVER WITH THE RPM PACKAGE MANAGER USING THE "RPM" COMMAND..

RPM -i HTTPD-2.4.37-21.MODULE_EL8.2.0+494+1DF74EAE.X86_64 .RPM (i- FOR INSTALL)
ERROR:  FAILED DEPENDENCIES:
                                HTTPD FILESYSTEM IS NEEDED BY HTTPD-2.4.37-21.MODULE_EL8.2.0+494+1DF74EAE.X86_64 .RPM.
                                (AND  DISPLAYS OTHER ERRORS.)
    THE REASON FOR THIS IS BECAUSE RPM DOESN'T INSTALL DEPENDENCIES FOR PACKAGES. THAT'S WHY YUM,DNF AND ZYPPER ARE COMMONLY USED TO FULLY INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES AND THE PACKAGE......
    
MOST SOFTWARES NEEDS DEPENDENCIES BEFORE THEY CAN BE INSTALLED.

RPM -ivh <PACKAGE NAME>
-i FOR INSTALL
-v FOR VERBOSE OUTPUT. PROVIDES MORE DETAILED OUTPUT.
-h PRINT HASH MARKS AS PACKAGE INSTALLS TO SHOW THE PROGRESS OF THE INSTALLATION. SUITABLE WITH -v

RPM -q package name- TO SEE THE VERSION OF THE PACKAGE INSTALLED
RPM -l - TO LIST THE FILE THAT GOT INSTALLED...
RPM -d -TO SEE ALL THE DOCUMENTATIONS..
RPM -a -TO LIST ALL PACKAGES INSTALLED ON THE SYSTEM..
RPM -e -TO EXTRACT AND UNINSTALL A PACKAGE.

RPM COMMAND IS USED FOR INSTALLING PACKAGES WITH .RPM FORMAT AND NOT ANY SOFTWARE FORMAT. YUM AND DNF ARE USED IN CENTOS WHILE ZYPPER IS USED FOR RPM PACKAGES IN FEDORA...........
