OBJECTIVES
--
USING DPKG TOOLS TO INSTALL DEB PACKAGES..
UNDERSTAND THE USE OF DPKG COMMAND TO WORK WITH DEB FILES..
USE THE APT, APT-GET, AND APT-CACHE COMMANDS TO MANAGE PACKAGES.
WORK WITH THE GRAPHICAL APTITUDE TOOL..

DPKG
--
DPKG IS THE COMMAND LINE TOOL USED TO MANAGE DEB PACKAGES IN DEBIAN BASED DISTROS.
LIKE RPM, DPKG DOES NOT INSTALL DEPENDENCIES.
DPKG -i <PACKAGE NAME>- TO INSTALL PACKAGES
DPKG -I <PACKAGE NAME>- WILL GIVE INFO ABOUT THE PACKAGE..
DPKG -L <PACKAGE NAME>- LISTS ALL FILES THAT GOT INSTALLED WITH THE PACKAGE..
DPKG -r <PACKAGE NAME> - REMOVES THE INSTALLED PACKAGE AND ITS DEPENDENCIES.

APT-GET
--
THE APT-GET COMMAND IS A PACKAGE MANAGER USED IN DEBIAN BASED DISTROS..
THE APT OR APT-GET CAN BE USED TO INSTALL PACKAGES AND ITS DEPENDENCIES.
ANYTIME WE ARE WORKING WITH APT OR APT-GET, THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS TO RUN AN UPDATE WITH "APT GET UPDATE". WHAT IT DOES IS, IT LOOKS IN THE REPOSITORIES, READS THE PACKAGES LIST, MAKES SURE WE HAVE THE UP TO DATE INFORMATION FOR APT  TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED, WHAT PACKAGES ARE OUT THERE AND WHAT DEPENDENCIES ARE OUT THERE TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN...

APT PURGE <PACKAGE NAME>- TO REMOVE ANYTHING WE DON'T NEED OF THE PACKAGE THAT IS STUCK IN THE SYSTEM.
APT INSTALL <PACKAGE NAME>- INSTALLS PACKAGE
APT-CACHE SHOW <PACKAGE NAME>- WILL SHOW US THE INFO ABOUT THE PACKAGE.
APT-CACHE PKGNAMES- WILL SHOW US ALL PACKAGES INSTALLED.
APT REMOVE <PACKAGE NAME>- TO REMOVE A PACKAGE
APT SEARCH <PACKAGE NAME> - WILL TELL US IF THE PACKAGE IS OUT THERE AND CAN BE INSTALLED BY APT

OTHER APT-GET COMMANDS.
APT-GET DIST-UPGRADE
APT-GET UPGRADE-TELLS US WHAT PACKAGES WE ARE TO UPDATE
APT-GET REMOVE --AUTOREMOVE SOFTWARE SOFTWARE-*
APT-GET UPDATE --FIX-MISSING- FIXES BROKEN AND MISSING PACKAGES
APT-GET UPGRADE --FIX-MISSING - UPGRADES MISSING AND BROKEN PACKAGES..
APT CLEAN- CLEANS UP THE SYSTEM AND MAKES EVERYTHING READY TO GO.
 

APTITUDE
--
APTITUDE IS A TEXT BASED GRAPHICAL PACKAGE MANAGER THAT WORKS LIKE APT-GET
+ BUTTON TO INSTALL A PACKAGE..
g TO PREVIEW/DOWNLOAD/INSTALL/REMOVE SELECTED PACKAGE 

THINK OF DPKG IN PLACE OF RPM IN DEBIAN AND APT-GET IN PLACE OF YUM OR DNF.
