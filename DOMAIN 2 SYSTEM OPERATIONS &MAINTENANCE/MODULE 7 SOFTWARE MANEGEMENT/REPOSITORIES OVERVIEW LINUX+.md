OBJECTIVES

UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE REPOSITORY IN LINUX..
FIND REPOSITORY FILES IN CENTOS AND UBUNTU.
KNOW HOW A REPOSITORY FILE IS CONFIGURED..

MOST LINUX PACKAGES EXIST IN A REPOSITORY.
A REPOSITORY IS A SERVER THAT HOLDS A COLLECTION OF SOFTWARES.
- KIND OF LIKE A GROCERY STORE THAT HOLDS A COLLECTION OF FOOD!

A LINUX SYSTEM GETS APPLICATION AND SOFTWARE UPDATES FROM THE REPOSITORY SERVER.

REPOSITORY FILE LOCATION
=
BUT HOW DOES THE LINUX SYSTEM KNOW WHERE THESE REPOSITORIES ARE?
IT USES A REPOSITORY FILE!
RED HAT BASED DISTROS (CENTOS ) KEEP REPOSITORY FILES IN /ETC/YUM.REPOS.D
DEBIAN BASED DISTROS(UBUNTU) HAVE ONE FILE /ETC/APT/SOURCES.LIST

STRUCTURE OF A CENTOS REPOSITORY FILE
=
THERE ARE SEVEN SECTIONS OF THE REPO FILE TO BE AWARE OF:
1) THE SECTION NAME- THE NAME ENCLOSED IN BRACKETS, HERE IT IS [BASEOS]
2) NAME- A DESCRIPTIVE NAME FOR THE REPOSITORY
3) MIRRORLIST OR BASEURL- A PATH OR URL FOR A REPOSITORY OR LIST OF REPOSITORIES ON THE INTERNET(MIRRORLIST).
4) GPG- USED TO CHECK AUTHENTICITY OF A REPO IF gpgcheck=1 SYSTEM IS CHECKING THE GPG SIGNATURE OF THE REPO; GPGKEY FILE LOCATION MUST ALSO BE PROVIDED.
5) ENABLE- WHETHER THE REPO IS ACTIVELY USED BY THE SYSTEM, 1 FOR ENABLED, 0 FOR DISABLED.

STRUCTURE OF THE UBUNTU SOUCES.LIST FILE
=
IN GENERAL, IT IS SUFFICIENT TO KNOW UBUNTU HAS /ETC/APT/SOURCES.LIST.

A LITTLE MORE DETAIL, EACH REPO HAS ITS OWN LINE AND THERE ARE FOUR MAIN REPOS:
- MAIN- CANNONICAL-SUPPORTED SOFTWARE.
- UNIVERSE- COMMUNITY-MAINTAINED SOFTWARE
- RESTRICTED- PROPRIETARY DRIVERS FOR DEVICES.
- MULTIVERSE - SOFTWARE RESTRICTED BY COPYRIGHTS OR LEGAL ISSUES.
