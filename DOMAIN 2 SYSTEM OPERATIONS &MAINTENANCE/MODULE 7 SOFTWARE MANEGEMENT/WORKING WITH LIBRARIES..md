OBJECTIVES
--
UNDERSTAND HOW LINUX USES LIBRARY FILES AND SHARED LIBRARIES.
USE THE LDD AND IDCONFIG COMMANDS.


SHARED LIBRARIES ON LINUX
--
IN THE PREVIOUS LESSON WE TALKED ABOUT THE C COMPILER.
THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USES LIBRARY FILES, WHICH ARE SHARED BETWEEN APPLICATIONS.
APPLICATIONS ACCESS COMMON FUNCTIONS VIA THESE SHARED LIBRARIES.


SHARED LIBRARY TYPES
--
HISTORICALLY, PROGRAMS COULD USE A STATIC LIBRARY:
-THIS WAS SPECIFIC TO A PROGRAM OR VERSION
-STATIC LIBRARIES HAS THE .a EXTENSION.
-THSES ARE NOW DEPRECATED BY DYNAMIC SHARED LIBRARIES.

DYNAMIC SHARED LIBRARIES ARE:
-FILES WITH A .so SUFFIX  (so FOR SHARED OBJECT).
-USED BY DEVELOPERS IN THEIR CODE
-FUNCTIONS CALLED AT RUN TIME.

IF A SHARED LIBRARY ISN'T ON THE SYSTEM, THE APPLICATION MIGHT THROW ERRORS OR CRASH. 


THE LDD COMMAND 
--
HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE LIBRARIES EXIST AND APPLICATIONS DON'T CRASH?
HOW DO YOU TRACK DOWN LIBRARIES?
YOU USE THE LDD COMMAND!

THE LDD COMMAND IS USED TO FIND LIBRARIES NECESSARY FOR A PROGRAM TO RUN:
-ldd <full path to program name>
EXAMPLE: ldd /usr/bin/diff  


LIBRARY PATHS, ld.so
---
LIBRARY FILES CAN BE STORED IN A FEW PLACES, GENERALLY:
-  /lib, /usr/lib
- /lib64, /usr/lib64

PATHS TO LIBRARY FILES ARE FOUND AT:
/etc/ld.so.conf
/etc/ld.so.conf.d
LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

THE DYNAMIC LINKER, ld.so
--
BUT HOW DOES AN APPLICATION FIND A SPECIFIC SHARED LIBRARY?
THE APPLICATION CALLS THE DYNAMIC LINKER (A.K.A ld.so)

- THE DYNAMIC LINKER IS AWARE OF ALL THE SHARED LIBRARIES
- LIKE A LIBRARIAN KNOWS WHERE TO FIND BOOKS IN A LIBRARY.
- IT LOADS THE LIBRARY NEEDED BY THE APPLICATION.

THE ldconfig command
--

BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CAN'T FIND A LIBRARY?

ALL HOPE IS NOT LOST, YOU CAN RUN THE ldconfig command!

THE ldconfig COMMAND IS WHAT IS USED TO BUILD THE ld.so.cache FILE.
-THIS FILE IS USED BY THE DYNAMIC LINKER TO FIND SHARED LIBRARIES.
-RE-RUNNING THE COMMAND MAY REFRESH THE LIBRARY LIST
-AFTER THAT, IT'S TIME TO PLAY LIBRARY HUNT.
