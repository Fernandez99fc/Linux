A KILL COMMAND: THE SYSADMIN BEST FRIEND
--
THE KILL COMMANDS AND PROCESS SIGNALS ARE TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT IN DEALING WITH PROCESSES.
YOU WILL AT SOME POINT HAVE TO DEAL WITH A BAD PROCESS; 
NOHUP'D PROCESS A COLLEAGUE RAN BEFORE LOGGING OFF, NOW CAUSING ISSUES.
A USER JOB THAT CRASHED AND STRANDED CHILD PROCESS(ZOMBIES).
A PROCESS LEAKING MEMORY.

KNOWING THE APPROPRIATE KILL COMMAND AND SIGNAL TO USE IS IMPORTANT AND WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF PAIN DOWN THE ROAD.

KILL COMMANDS
--
WE COVER PROCESSES MORE IN MODULE 22, BUT FOR NOW RECALL THE TOP COMMAND FROM MODULE 11.
TOP SHOWS PROCESS PID FOR EACH RUNNING PROCESS
WE CAN PASS THE PID FOR A PROCESS TO THE KILL COMMAND TO TERMINATE IT:
KILL <PID>
HOWEVER, IF WE DONT KNOW THE PID, BUT WE DO KNOW THE PROCESS NAME, WE CAN USE PKILL.
THE PKILL COMMAND WILL KILL ALL PROCESSES RELATED TO THAT PROCESS NAME:
PKILL CUPS- KILLS ALL PRINTER-RELATED PROCESSES.

PROCESS SIGNALS AND KILLS
--
AS WE SAW IN THE LAST LESSON, THERE ARE A FEW PROCESS SIGNALS;
SIGHUP(1);HANGS UP/ CLEANS UP TERMINAL AFTER LOGOUT
SIGINT(2);QUITS A RUNNING TERMINAL PROCESS
SIGSTP(19);STOPS, PUT PROCESS INTO MEMORY.

THE KILL COMMAND CAN ALSO ACCEPT PROCESS SIGNALS AND HAS TWO SPECIFIC PROCESS SIGNALS OF ITS OWN;
THE KILL COMMAND RUNS THE SIGTERM(15)  BY DEFAULT 
SIGTERM TELLS A PROCESS TO TERMINATE GRACEFULLY.
SIGKILL(9) IS A BRUTE-FORCE KILL, CALLED WITH: KILL -9 <PID>
SIGKILL KILLS PROCESS WITHOUT WAITING FOR IT TO EXIT GRACEFULLY.
