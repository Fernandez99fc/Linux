OBJECTIVES
--
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CRON DAEMON IN PROCESS SCHEDULING.
UNDERSTAND HOW THE CRON AND ANACRON DAEMONS WORKS.
LOCATE THE FILES AND DIRECTORY THAT CRON USES.

THE CRON DAMEON
--
THE CRON DAEMON HANDLES JOB SCHEDULING IN LINUX.
CRON COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD FOR TIME, CHRONOS.

THE CRON DAEMON RUNS A JOB ON A FINXED SCHEDULE; JOBS THAT RUN REGULARLY ARE;
FOUNDATIONAL PROCESSES USING CRON SCHEDULES.
THE CRON DAEMON, CRON IS CONFIGURED TO START WHEN THE SYSTEM BOOTS.

THE CRON DAEMON IN DETAIL
--
CROND RUNS IN THE BACKGROUND AND CHECKS USER "CRON TABLES" USING THE UTILITY CRONTAB(DISCUSSED IN THE NEXT LESSON).
CROND ALSO USES A GLOBAL, SYSTEM CRONTAB;
/ETC/CRONTAB TO RUN SCRIPTS AT SCHEDULED INTERVALS;
/ETC/CRON.HOURLY-HOLDS CRON SCRIPTS THAT RUN HOURLY.
/ETC/CRON.DAILY- HOLDS CRON SCRIPTS THAT RUNS DAILY.
/ETC/CRON.WEEKLY- HOLDS CRON SCRIPTS THAT RUNS WEEKLY
/ETC/CRON.MONTHLY-HOLDS CRON SCRIPTS THAT RUN MONTHLY.

THESE FOUR INTERVALS ABOVE ARE DIRECTORIES -A SYSTEM TASK SCRIPT CAN BE PLACED INTO THESE DIRECTORY TO RUN AT THAT TIME.

CRON VS ANACRON
--
SOME LINUX DISTRIBUTION USE ANOTHER SCHEDULER ALONG WITH CRON CALLED ANACRON.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A JOB IS SCHEDULED TO RUN AND THE SYSTEM IS DOWN?
IF YOU'RE RUNNING CRON, THE JOB WILL NOT RUN.
ANACRON RUNS MISSED JOBS WHEN THE SYSTEM COMES UP.
IT LOOKS AT THE TIMESTAMPS OF THE FILES IN /VAR/SPOOL/ANACRON AND THE /ETC/ANACRONTAB FILE TO DETERMINE WHEN TO RE-RUN THE JOB.

NOTE: ANACRON IS NOT EXPLICITLY CALLED OUT ON THE LINUX+ BUT YOU WILL SEE IT IRL, BUT I WILL EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS.
